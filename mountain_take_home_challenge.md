# Take-Home Engineering Challenge: Mountain Explorer

**Role:** Generalist Engineer (Fresh Graduate)  
**Duration:** Approx. 2 Days  
**Keyword:** Mountain

## ðŸ§  Overview

Create a **Mountain Explorer** web application that helps users discover and learn about famous mountains around the world. This project will showcase your ability to build a full-stack system that integrates data presentation, search functionality, and basic API interactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

1. **System Design Document**
   - Sketch the architecture of your system (frontend, backend, data source).
   - Include a simple diagram and short description of component roles.

2. **Frontend - Mountain Directory UI**
   - Build a simple React (or equivalent) app to:
     - Display a list of mountains with names, heights, and locations.
     - Filter by continent or country.
     - View a mountainâ€™s detailed page or modal with an image and extra facts.

3. **Backend/API**
   - Serve mountain data via `/api/mountains` endpoint.
   - You may use public data (e.g., from Wikipedia or mock a dataset with ~10 mountains).
   - Include fields like: name, height (m), location, range, first ascent.

4. **Bonus (Optional)**
   - Integrate a map (e.g., Leaflet or Google Maps) to plot mountain locations.
   - Add a comparison feature (e.g., compare heights or ranges).

## ðŸ§ª Deliverables

- Project source code (GitHub repo or zip).
- A `README.md` file that covers:
  - Setup instructions.
  - Overview of app and architecture.
  - Notes on future improvements or expansions.
- Screenshot or link to a demo if deployed.

## âœ… Evaluation Criteria

- Simplicity and clarity of implementation.
- Data handling and UI/UX execution.
- Use of modern engineering practices.
- Completeness of features and documentation.

**Tip:** Focus on data modeling, clean UI, and how you'd expand this app further (e.g., weather on the summit, hiking routes, difficulty ratings, etc.).
